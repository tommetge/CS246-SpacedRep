Summary:

The user will interact with the application in two key ways:

1. Collecting and inserting information that the user wishes to recall. The user will be prompted to provide a summary, which is used in the reminder, and the full information to recall. This information can be:
  - Text-based information
  - Scheduling (calendaring)
  - Photos
  - PDFs
2. Viewing reminders that the application presents to the user a specific times during the day or week. Reminders include:
  - Text-based summary of the information to recall
  - An option to show the full text (or other original material)

Required Features:

The minimum viable product will:

1. Collect information from the user:
  - Collect text-based information
  - Collect a text-based summary of the information (for use in the reminder)
2. Render reminders on a algorithmically-generated schedule:
  - Algorithm for time-spacing reminders
  - Display the user-provided summary for each item
  - Provide an interactive way for the user to view the full text or original information

Stretch Goals:

In addition to the MVP described above, we would like to:

1. Collection information from the user (in additional formats):
  - Collect scheduling or calendaring information
  - Collect photos
  - Collect PDFs
2. Render reminders:
  - Provide an interactive way for the user to view the additional formats via the reminder
  - Set a configurable timer during which the reminder remains on screen (so the user can't dismiss and ignore it)
3. Syncing data across devices:
  - Use a data API to store and sync collected information and reminder schedules across multiple devices.

User Stories:

Virginia (our sponsor) is struggling to recall information necessary to succeed in several classes in school. She is specifically concerned with Math. She opens the Spaced Repetition app and:

1. Presses the "+" button to add a new tidbit for recall
2. Fills in the text summary with: "Area of a circle"
3. Fills in the text to recall with: "Area = Pi * (Radius * Radius)"
4. She taps save and the the new tidbit is added to her list
5. She closes the app and continues with her day
6. In the evening, the app presents a reminder with "Area of a circle" included
7. Virginia attempts to recall the equation and taps the button in the reminder to check
8. The app presents the text to recall ("Area = Pi * (Radius * Radius)").
9. Virginia again closes the app
10. The following morning, the app presents a reminder with "Area of a circle" included
11. This sequence is repeated two days later, then 4 days, and again one week later

As a stretch goal, we would like the app to accept additional formats of information. The user story for this case is as follows:

1. Virginia presses the "+" button to add a new tidbit for recall
2. She fills in the text summary with: "U.S. population in the 20th century"
3. She taps "Add photo" and adds a JPG with a chart showing the population of the U.S. throughout the 20th century
4. She taps save and the new tidbit is added to her list
5. The app offers reminders as described in the first story (the base case)
