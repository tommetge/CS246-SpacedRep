Login screen:
- No nav bar in the login screen
- Should have some kind of app identity - logo, label, welcome message, etc.

Main screen:
- Logout option should move to the nav bar (menu option)
- (Done) List should expand to the whole width of the screen (close to the edge at least)
- (Done) Nav bar: instead of the name, add a welcome message there. The name is unnecessary - should be a description of where the user is at in the app (Home, etc.)
- (Done) "Nothing to review" button should match the colors and design of the app - so blue.

Add screen:
- "Spaced Repetition" - gone, show
- "Edit Reminder" - not accurate, should be "Add Reminder". Should be in the nav bar.
- Save button: not material design. Make part of the menu - check icon or floppy disk button.

Delete/Edit popup:
- Reconsider

Review:
- Use the same color scheme for the buttons (back, forward, reveal)
- Reveal button should be wider
- Nav item: remove the app name, show the reminder
- Move the save to the menu item
- Back / forward button on each side / corner of the bottom
