# CS246-SpacedRep

Spaced Repetition is a method to improve long-term recall of information stored in memory. Research demonstrates that repeated review sessions at specific time intervals dramatically improves long-term recall. Our app sends time-based reminders at these research-backed intervals to help automate this process. Information to recall is provided by the user and can be anything - text, image, link, audio, etc.

## Example Schedule

Reminder schedule:

1. First reminder: 1 day after adding
2. 2 days later
3. 2 days later
4. 2 days later (total 7 days)
5. each week for one month (total 1 month 1 week)
6. every other week for 3 months (total 4 months 1 week)
7. every 3rd week for 6 months (total 10 months 1 week)
8. each month for one year (total 1 year 10 months 1 week)
